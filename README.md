nad_configurations
==================

Configuration files in JSON format that describe metrics and graphs for the Node Agent Daemon to use during self-registration.

This is VERY MUCH a work-in-progress at the moment.

Some of the configurations require nad plugins from the repo here: https://github.com/bixu/nad_plugins
